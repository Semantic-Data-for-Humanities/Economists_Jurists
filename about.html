      <h2>Delimitation of the study</h2>
      <p>
        It is important to define a population's boundaries, to distinguish who is inside
        and outside of the definitions of "economist" and "jurist" and correctly request the SPARQL endpoints.
     </p>
        <h3>Economist</h3>
     <p>
        We will start by defining the word "economist" First of all, we can read Cambridge dictionary's definition:
        <figure>
          <blockquote cite="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/economist">
            <p>a person who studies or has a special knowledge of economics.</p>
          </blockquote>
          <figcaption>Cambridge dictionary,
            <cite>economist</cite>
          </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
        This definition is quite simple.
        We can repeat the same procedure for the definition of "economics":
       </p>
        <figure>
          <blockquote cite="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/economics">
            <p>the scientific study of the system by which a country’s wealth is made and used </p>
          </blockquote>
          <figcaption>Cambridge dictionary,
             <cite>economics</cite>
           </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <br>
        <p>
        By this definition, we can say that the "economist" is someone who is a specialist of the system above
        (even if other definitions are given, this one is the best for us).
        It is also interesting to see the definition given on Wikipedia
        (since part of our data comes from it).
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
        We can notice that there is a distinction between the term "economics"
        (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics",title="Wikipedia_en_Economics", target="_blank">Wikipedia en - Economics</a>)
        and the term "economy" (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy",title="Wikipedia_en_Economy", target="_blank">
        Wikipedia en - Economy</a>).
        This distinction is also in French but without a different word to distinguish them.
        In French, we have the word "économie"
        (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia%C3%89conomie_(discipline)", title="Wikipedia_fr_economie_disc", target="_blank">
        Wikipedia fr - économie (disclipline)</a>) as a scientific discipline and économie as an area (<a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89conomie_(activit%C3%A9_humaine)", title="Wikipedia_fr_economie_act", target="_blank">
        Wikipedia fr - économie (activité humaine)</a>).
        The Wikipedia definition on "economics" is clearer:
       </p>
       <figure>
         <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics">
           <p>Economics is the social science that studies how people interact with value; in particular, the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services
           </p>
         </blockquote>
         <figcaption>Wikipedia en,
            <cite>economics</cite>
          </figcaption>
       </figure>
      <p>
        Now, in our study, we will only use the term "économie" as a scientific discipline.
        In addition, in the French language, there is an opposition between the terms "économie politique" (political economics)
        and "économie domestique" (consumer economics). However in English language, 'consumer economics' is a branch of economics
        and 'political economics' is a distinct discipline.
      </p>
        <h3>Jurist</h3>
        <p>
        We can use the same procedure for the definition of jurist. The Cambridge dictionary gives this definition:
        <figure>
          <blockquote cite="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/jurist">
            <p>
             an expert in law, especially a judge
            </p>
          </blockquote>
          <figcaption>Cambridge dictionary,
             <cite>jurist</cite>
           </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
        There is a little difference with the Wikipedia definition:
        <p>
        <figure>
          <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurist">
          <p>A jurist is a person with expert knowledge of law; someone who analyses and comments on law.
        This person is usually a specialist legal scholar—not necessarily with a formal qualification
         in law or a legal practitioner, although in the United States the term “jurist” may be applied to a judge. […]
         The English term jurist is to be distinguished from similar terms in other European languages, where it may be
         synonymous with legal professional, i.e. anyone with a professional law degree that qualifies for legal work.
         </p>
         </blockquote>
         <figcaption>Wikipedia en,
            <cite>jurist</cite>
          </figcaption>
       </figure>
       <p>
        In comparison, we can read the french definition of "juriste":
       <p>
         <figure>
           <blockquote cite="https://www.cnrtl.fr/definition/juriste">
           <p>Celui qui, spécialisé dans la science du droit, en fait profession, par la pratique ou par des écrits.
           </p>
         </blockquote>
         <figcaption>CNRTL,
            <cite>juriste</cite>
          </figcaption>
       </figure>
       <p>
        We can observe a distinction between the French term of "juriste" and the English term.
        The French definition is closer to the definition of "legal professional":
      </p>
        <figure>
          <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_profession">
            <p>
            Legal profession is a profession, and legal professionals study, develop and apply law.
            Usually, there is a requirement for someone choosing a career in law to first obtain a law degree
            or some other form of legal education.
           </p>
          </blockquote>
          <figcaption>Wikipedia en,
             <cite>Legal profession</cite>
           </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
        We can notice that the words "lawyer" and "juriste", are similar:
       </p>
        <figure>
          <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer)">
            <p>
        A lawyer or attorney is a person who practices law, as an advocate, attorney at law,
        barrister, barrister-at-law, bar-at-law, canonist, canon lawyer, civil law notary, counsel,
        counselor, counsellor, solicitor, legal executive, or public servant preparing, interpreting
        and applying law, but not as a paralegal or charter executive secretary. Working as a lawyer
        involves the practical application of abstract legal theories and knowledge to solve specific
        individualized problems, or to advance the interests of those who hire lawyers to perform legal services.
        The role of the lawyer varies greatly across different legal jurisdictions.
           </p>
        </blockquote>
     <figcaption>Wikipedia en,
        <cite>Lawyer</cite>
      </figcaption>
   </figure>
      <p>
        In our research, all three definitions can describe a jurist therefore we will use them to do our SPARQL queries.
