# Economists_Jurists

This repository presents datas (birth, occupation, honor, school, influence by, influenced, etc.) about jurists and economists from 1800 to now. The goal is to understand the interaction between people in these two professions. For that, we are using the datas availables on DBpedia, Wikidata and BnF.data and we do requests with the SPARQL language and statistics with the matplotlib library by using the python language.
