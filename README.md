# Economists_Lawyers

This repository presents datas (birth, occupation, honor, school, influence by, influenced, etc.) about lawyers and economists from 1800 to now. The goal is to understand the interaction between people in these two professions. For that, we are using the datas availables on DBpedia and BnF.data and we do requests with the SPARQL language and statistics with the matplotlib library by using the python language.
