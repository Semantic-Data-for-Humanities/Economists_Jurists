          "Economists and jurists" is a project of the prosopographical study of economists and jurists from the XIXth century to now. <br/><br/>
           This project will be carried out using the data made available on the <a href="https://dbpedia.org/" title="DBpedia " target="_blank">DBpedia</a>,
           <a href="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Main_Page" title="Wikidata " target="_blank">Wikidata</a>
          and <a href="https://data.bnf.fr/" title="BnF Data " target="_blank">BnF Data</a> SPARQL endpoints.
          The data will be aggregated and cleansed, the final aim is to obtain a certain volume of consistent information,
          expressed with a coherent ontology, in order to implement some analysis and identify some characteristics and
          structural aspects of this population.</p>
        <section>
        <p> Inside this website, you will find different types of information.<br/>
            First, it is possible to find <a href="about.html">explanations</a> about the study's finalities. That is to say, how we chose the population: Who are the potential individuals into this study, during which chronological milestones, and in which geographical bounds.
            Then, the all analysis are realised with Jupyter notebooks. The all <a href="notebooks.html">notebooks</a> that we have carried out are available and explained.<br/>
            <br>
